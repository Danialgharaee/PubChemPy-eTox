# PubChemPy Compounds to CSV

This notebook allows you to fetch PubChem compounds based on a given CID and a threshold for the Tanimoto score. The Tanimoto score is used to filter compounds based on similarity, with the threshold specifying the minimum score for a compound to be considered a hit. The results are formatted into a CSV file suitable for [Neurosnap eTox Drug Toxicity Prediction](https://neurosnap.ai/service/eTox%20Drug%20Toxicity%20Prediction).
